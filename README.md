We would like to see hacks in the following areas:
Education: for example making education more accessible through using Avaya’s resources in the classroom.
Healthcare: for example alerts, reminders, support applications, IoT devices like fitness/health trackers, to help patients and healthcare providers achieve better health outcomes.
Energy & Environment: for example promoting the use of green energy or enforcing / raising awareness of environmental policies.
St. Mary’s Food Bank: Today we only have a webpage where people can enter their zip code or what they are specifically looking for (a hot meal, a non-perishable food box, fresh produce) and see what services are available to them close by, http://www.azfoodbanks.org/index.php/foodbank/index/. We’d like to improve access to this service across voice, text, or an app on people’s phones.
